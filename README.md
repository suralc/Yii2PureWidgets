**YiiPureWidgets** (WIP!)
===

This is a partial port of the [bootstrap widgets](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/tree/master/framework/yii/bootstrap) included in the yii-core to [Pure](http://purecss.io/).

This is work in progress and as of now just a proof of concept. I'll be going to implement the full set of pure functions in the following weeks (later then sooner).

Extension concept is based on Antonio Ramirez, Qiang Xue's, Alexander Kochetov's and possibly many others work on yii2.
